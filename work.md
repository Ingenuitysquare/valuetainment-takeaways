Talent, degree, nationality do not matter/determine your workethic.

 ## 1 Be predictable 
 Be predictable showing up and working by your highest standards every day (i.e. show at 8 end midnight 12)
 
 * momentum those who steadily grow their business show up every day without deisrupting their momentum...
 * If you truly need to expand and keep momentum you got to be predictable 

girlfriend, kids, wife, financial challenge, family issues --- despite these you are predictable

## 2 consistency
Keep showing up and doing your efforts and avoid small issues you encounter to ruin your consistency.
Whenever possible prepare the night before. Proper planning prevents the poor performance.

## 3 prepare the night before
* the guy that is the most prepared wins, prepare the week before, prepare before the conference
* conference, meeting he prepares 9 months before... a folder where he's adding stuff.
## 4 do more
how big is your purpose, does your activity fits/suits, are you putting your work-ethic

* out-practice things do a little bit more
## Subscribe to the "now mentality"

* subscribe to the "now mentality" not later or tomorrow
* have a sense of urgency solves the issues more quickly

## 6 find a running mate
five more reps, three more reps... keep running mates that push each-other to working hard
*nothing big is build by working as little as possible

## 7 Don't fall for the "Work Smart Only" concept

## 8 cut distractions
get rid of the distractions in the office, focus in the performace

## 9 absolute focus
you gotta train the mind to be focues, stop making excuses practice is like a musscle

## 10 have a to do list
what needs to get done next
can you handle... 

## 11 eat right

## 12 plug the leaks

# 13 cut the fat
work that somebody else can do ... when working 
just because you are in the office does not mean that you are working hard

# 14 Drop perfection
sometimes a personece gets obsessed to take the shot and you loose the shot, take the shot ... go to that appointment
*Take the short rather than seeking perfection

# 15 How to avoid burn out
stairs, go the beach, read, cafee, earth cafee, home
find ways to have your own escape. find your rewards... if you do this you qualify for that.
* find your carrot and your next one

The most important thing of work, ethic, morals is for you and how do they currently apply to you.
