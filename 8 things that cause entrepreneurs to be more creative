Be curius about life, health, yourself, people around you, society...

Keep your energy levels healthy to help you better with the creative process.
Figure out a way to get inspired

Ask more questions... put a problem...and have other people tackle and process that problem to solve the issues
in that way you may get better at the cretivity process..

So, pick any topic.. imagine how can you make to oting system better
whay do you think of x, y, z ? why Elon Musk said that...? Mark Cuban said you're a moron if you borrow money... why would he say that? what do you think about that?
