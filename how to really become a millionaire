Write a book and have in its title with a millionaire will do just good enough..

you naturally compare with the best ones that are "anomalies" with the rest

What it really takes to become a millinaire

1. Know your timeline when builing a business
- first 2 years-Survival mode
- 5 years 250000-500000
- 10 years 1 Million
- 20 years 10 Million

2. Know the 4 elements
 # 2.1 workethic
 Being hardworker/deep worker and knowing what it means and how they are different from just being at the workplace...
 (Avoid coasting, lag-time at work sitting and drifing off from your main work)
  level 1 - Part timer ()
  level 2 - Full timer (40)
  level 3 -  All the timer (80 hours a week)
  * To know your level ask yourself how hard was I working before, how about during superbowl/weekends/parties/holidays how much do they influence your work ethic?
  ...that is were you can categorize ourselfs... one-time or few-timer hard-worker does not qualify you... everyone has a week to brag about.
  
  # 2.2 Personal growth speed
  If you are working constantly working working ... you may get into the rabbit hole of forgetting if your mindset is growing. 
  Thus, your identity does not grow limiting your operational/strategic/level of thinking. So, work-hard, learn, constantly feed yourself with books/expertise info, get feedback and reflect...
  
  * Books/literature that helps you solve issues in your current context of the business you are doing... simply fantasy books does not do it.
  # 2.3 The frequency of Start/Stops
  level 1 (part-timer) - 2 to 4 setbacks / distractions/ year
  -bankruptcy
  -breakup
  -loss of a loved ones/relationship
  level 2 (full timer) - 1 setback per year/
  level 3 (all-the-timer) - 1 every 5 to 10 years
  
  # 2.4 Number of Industries
  level 1 (part timer) - changes to new industry every 2 to 4 years
  (As quickly as possible this did not work.. I am going to do that...)
  level 2 (full timer) - changes industry 5 to 10 y ears
  level 3 (all timer) - 20-40 years one industry
  
  Intangibles:
  
  *Know that there are conditions/ intangibles that should be in your side to your goals' accomplishment.
  want vs must
  focus
  amtbition
  desire
  positioning /equity (are you increasing value)
  marriage (risks, compromises you are willing to do)
  chip (do you have a chip on your shoulders, reason, cause ...someone you are proving righ/wrong...)
  prove righ/wrong
  risks
  decision making process
  friends/ associations (do you revert back to bad habits?)
  luck/timing

  * Success in not a part-time nor full-time thing... but an all the timer thing* not matter what you are or aspire to be
