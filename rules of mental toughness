Rules of Mental Toughness

Can you measure mental toughness? if yes, how do you measure mental toughness?
Mutual fund return, weight, percentage of clothing sale, how about mental and emotional ?
As the saying goes "Never judge a book by its cover" same can apply for people "never judge toughness by its cover" why?

# 1. Know your mental standards and level
Because you might look calm outside as a person/character thought how you handle pain, pressure and difficult situations could show how much toughness you got in the tank.
Hence, pain tolerance is the biggest factor of someone handling pressure

Think of what Ralph Emerson said: "The difference between an average person vs hero is the hero does/goes to the extra minutes/mile/work"
hero vs amateur -- hand in there for few minutes longer... one measure

# 2. Preparation

second is preparatio...(imagine te david blame how long can i hold th breath)

* Know your body do research for it and prepare to keep expanding that mental toughness...
Role played the speeach got and prepared ... so preparation has a lot to do with toughness..
imagine chadwick boseman... his approach was how do you get people thinking in different ways?
how much people show hurt.. that is where you show toughness... and could be a measured by reading their highlights in the conversation.
Know that when you feel pain it is happening in you and unique to you which means other people do not understand it and probably do not need to.
Thus, sometimes is not good to advertise your pain.. of course privete conversation could be ok but not be public and need attention
look for attention different from mental toughnesss in fact you show weaknesses

Life will test you and challenge in different ways... in ways that you may never think were possible... 
but know what is the only possible thing is yourself being in a touch situation and take control to getting out of it. 
Figure out how to solve things especially when you're being test, with debt, girlfiend, family, army in various possible ways.

* Thus, be aware that you will be tested in: marriage, family in various ways.. in those moments the decisions we make.. those are moments when you measure your toughness.
toughness = f(results you are getting)

How about the opposite of toughness, soft?
What does soft mean to you?

(imagine what is the biggest compliment Kobe made for Shaq -he "was big and mean"

soft is someone that claims their values and when something gets tough compromises... 
#soft definition = could be shown as deflection of prior values/believes/promises under pressure
(think of someone or you! whether you might have sat in a corner and then quit because the situation became tough... 
or the case when you claimed certain values but then you quit... the case when you declared intention and then you quit the way out...
...and a lot of people are soft.. Radolph "said the only diff is that the hero vs avg guy is that the hero... goes extra "

Why going extra is important?
Understand that your minds' memory remembers the last few time you did it and/ or did not do it... that reministic effect might affect your actions later
your memory remembers and reacts the last times how you handles and to change you need to persevere and learn to handle that situations...


How Patrick has handled the pain in tough situations, under pressure?
How he handle pressure or threatened under this them of being told "you'll fail become unknown and lose your community, values ?
What might have been some of his feelings and first thoughts crossing his mind... ?
How would I have handled such situations, reacted or otherwise to solve that issue?

* it seems there is a certain mindset... that makes you fight until the end...

3. Keep yourself accountable

Do your fight to the very end that is the mind... you cannot talk to other people because you chose to do that.

Over-reaction, flight righ out the bat ... what relates to you when you've quit, over-react?

what is your immediate instict, flight? fight? freeze? being in these states sucks but when you come out of it there are a lot of great things

how do you build these things ?

what you should not do that one thing... never talk Pat your goals.. because he will hold you up to it... why are you not going after it? I take your work because his father was holding
accountable to your goals? and this is a quality that brings results...

...you want something to get resutls, said something and odne it ... do it.. be serious.

go a little longer, when tested under pressure ...talk yo yourself remember raldo emerson, daid blain he broke the world record... test your limits
to do that prepare and understand how great people handle that.
