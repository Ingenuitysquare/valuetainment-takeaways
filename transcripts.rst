Morning Rituals of an Entrepreneur
https://youtubetranscript.com/?v=eEirzGD525I&t=18


I believe your day as an entrepreneur is a pure reflection of your morning rituals.
00:06
How you start your day will determine the type of day you're going to end up having.
00:10
So, one of the most common questions people ask is, "Pat, I want to know how your day
00:13
starts.
00:14
What do you do in the morning?
00:15
What time do you wake up.
00:16
What time do you do this?
00:17
What time do you do that?"
00:18
So instead of just telling you what I do, I'll share with you exactly what I do in the
00:21
morning when I wake up.
00:22
I also went and got a list of people that I like, how they start their day to give you
00:27
some value and give them some love on their morning rituals.
00:30
And this is all entrepreneurs.
00:31
And by the way, I want to tell you something here for you to keep in mind.
00:34
You can't wing this area.
00:36
This is not an area for you to wing.
00:37
It's very simple.
00:38
This is not an area for you to wing, because think about it this way.
00:42
Everything is by momentum throughout the day.
00:44
It's all about momentum.
00:46
So every day is a mountain.
00:48
Every single day is a mountain.
00:49
This is a mountain here, so meaning you wake up in the morning and the higher the mountain
00:54
goes, the more excited your day starts, the more the snowball gets thicker and thicker
00:59
and thicker, the bigger it gets.
01:01
Right?
01:02
So you sleep, you're ready, boom you're day starts, boom boom boom boom, great day.
01:07
If you don't have a good start, it's a small mountain.
01:09
So you don't have a lot of time to create momentum.
01:11
It is very important on how you start your days in the morning.
01:14
So, not everybody does the same.
01:15
A lot of people have different types of things they do.
01:17
Some are single, some are married, some have kids, some don't have kids, so you have to
01:23
figure out something that works for you, regardless, regardless.
01:26
One of the most common things I hear from a lot of people is, you know, for me, I have
01:31
to wake up at 10:00 in the morning because I need to do this, this, that.
01:36
If you don't get your morning ritual down, and you have any desire to compete as an entrepreneur,
01:40
you are toast.
01:42
If you think you're going to be able to compete with the rest of the guys in the world of
01:46
business.
01:47
So let's go through a few of them here.
01:48
The first one, I want to give some love to Gary Vee.
01:50
Here's what I like what Gary Vee says on his morning ritual.
01:53
He wakes up at 6:00 AM, reads the new in the bathroom [something I do as well], and before
01:58
leaving the house he hugs his kids for five minutes and calls a family member while driving.
02:02
I like that.
02:03
Hugs his kids for five minutes and calls a family member while driving.
02:07
Gary, props to you for doing that.
02:09
Tony Robbins.
02:10
Tony Robbins has a very good ritual.
02:12
He doesn't have a specific time that he wakes up, because of the traveling that he does.
02:15
He may be in Europe, he may be here, so he doesn't have an "I wake up exactly at 4:45
02:18
or 5:50" or whatever.
02:20
He doesn't have that.
02:22
So he doesn't have a time for that.
02:23
He wakes up, he does a cold plunge, submerge for a full minute, under water, cold, cold
02:29
water, if you've ever done one of these cold dips, is what he does, and the primes of his
02:33
days, what he calls the primes of his days, three things.
02:36
One, he has a breaking exercise that he does.
02:38
If you see it, it's a very -- if you haven't seen the Tony Robbins documentary, I highly
02:42
recommend you watch the Tony Robbins documentary.
02:45
I don't even know what it's called.
02:47
but I do know if you go on Netflix, and you type in Tony Robbins documentary, it will
02:51
come up.
02:52
I highly recommend you watch it.
02:54
It's solid.
02:55
It shows how some of his events are.
02:57
It's "I'm Not Your Guru."
02:58
That's what the documentary is called.
03:00
Phenomenal.
03:01
And you kind of see a day of his life from what it looks like.
03:03
But the prime of his day he has his breathing exercise, you'll see how he does it.
03:07
You may not do it, but that's his.
03:10
Expressing gratitude, and prayer.
03:12
He's big on prayer, on what he does, which is pretty interesting.
03:17
His day is probably one of the most energetic people around the world that if you go to
03:21
his convention, you see him with his five, 10,000 people that he has.
03:26
Everybody is fired up, because his energy gets everybody else fired up.
03:30
You have more of a possibility of impacting people's lives if your energy is higher.
03:36
Morning ritual is purely an energy game is what you've got to keep in mind.
03:38
Zuckerberg.
03:39
Let's see what Zuckerberg does.
03:40
This is a guy that's worth 40 some billion, somewhere around there.
03:44
He wakes up at 8:00 a.m.
03:47
Interesting.
03:48
Not a lot -- you hear 5:00, he's an 8:00 a.m-er.
03:51
When he hasn't been working all night, so he's a guy that works all night til 2:00,
03:54
3:00 in the morning, but he wakes up at 8:00 a.m.
03:55
He wears the exact same shirt every single day because he doesn't want to spend a lot
03:59
of time thinking about what to wear, and so that's what he does.
04:03
Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter and Square.
04:05
He wakes up at 5:30 to meditate, followed by a six-mile jog.
04:09
Pretty intense.
04:11
Richard Branson, from Virgin group.
04:14
He is generally on his island.
04:16
He swims around the island or goes kite surfing it it's windy.
04:21
He then plays tennis before sitting down for a healthy breakfast.
04:24
He doesn't have a set time when he wakes up; he leaves his curtains open and it's where
04:28
exactly the sun rises.
04:29
He says, when the sun rises, the light wakes me up.
04:32
So he doesn't have an alarm clock, but typically the sun rises at 5:45, 6:00 in the morning.
04:38
Simon Cowell -- we don't know what time he wakes up.
04:42
He may be waking up about 11:00 in the morning but he does say what he does in the morning.
04:46
He resets the snooze button twice, before being served a breakfast of hot water with
04:50
lemon, papaya juice with lime, oatmeal, tea, and three smoothies.
04:56
Pretty specific.
04:57
And knowing his personality, I can actually see him doing that every single day.
05:01
Tory Burch, the designer.
05:02
She's worth around a billion, a little shy of a billion dollars.
05:06
Wakes up at 5:45 a.m., immediately checks her work emails, gets her three boys out of
05:13
bed and takes a 45 minute exercise such as a quick walk.
05:17
Now that's her routine.
05:18
Let me tell you what I do when I wake up in the morning.
05:21
Okay.
05:22
So, before I tell you what I do when I wake up in the morning, you've got to keep in mind,
05:25
I have three kids all under the age of five.
05:27
I'm married, I have three kids all under the age of five, I run a company with a ton of
05:32
employees and thousands of agents around the country selling insurance, annuities, and
05:36
investment products.
05:37
The company is called PHP Agency.
05:38
Now that's what I do as a business, right?
05:41
So, one of the things for me, just a couple of months back, three, four, five months back,
05:47
my dad -- if there's one thing my dad will not hesitate to do -- my dad will pull me
05:53
aside and he'll say, "Hey, Mr. Body Builder.
05:56
What happened to your six-pack?
05:57
Now you have a one-pack."
06:00
He has no filters.
06:01
If you're out of shape, he'll tell you.
06:03
Okay, he's good with the ladies; he won't tell that to the ladies, but he will tell
06:07
me, if I"m out of shape, he'll tell me.
06:08
Now I love that because I'd rather have the truth than you trying to make me feel good
06:12
as a father, as a mentor.
06:15
So I get on the scale, I weigh 256 is what I weigh.
06:19
I've never weighed 256 before.
06:21
The moment I noticed myself weighing 256, my energy goes high, my energy goes low, and
06:26
this was right around when the baby was born.
06:30
And when a baby is born, you're doing two hours of sleep, you're waking up and doing
06:33
all this other stuff.
06:34
No matter what happens, I feel it.
06:36
The moment I feel the energy dropping, the moment I feel it, I know, because I can't
06:42
hang till 10:00 11:00 if I'm starting early.
06:45
I know that.
06:46
And my business requires me to hang for a long time because it requires that I have
06:49
a lot of energy.
06:50
So there is a formula for every single person.
06:53
This isn't something - you need to ask yourself how is your energy in the morning, and how
06:57
is your energy in the afternoon.
06:58
And can you hang longer, or by 5:00, 6:00, you're already tired.
07:01
Keep in mind, your competitors wake up typically earlier than you, and they are able to last
07:05
longer than you.
07:06
That's the only reason they're growing faster than you and having a bigger business than
07:09
you, whatever type of a business they have in place.
07:12
That is if you're competitive.
07:13
Here's my morning.
07:14
I wake up generally at 4:30 - 4:45 a.m., and have training sessions at 5:00.
07:19
If I have a training session with my trainers at 6:00, I'm up 5:15.
07:24
This morning I had a training session at 6:00; I can no longer help myself.
07:28
It's a 4:45 wake up.
07:30
At 4:45 I wake up, I'll check my email, I'll go through all the information that I have
07:35
on my email, I'll typically listen to an audio book, while I'm driving or walking around.
07:41
I will do my daily affirmations on what I tell myself.
07:45
It's been one of my rituals for a long, long time.
07:48
I have my affirmations laminated all over the wall.
07:50
They are all over my shower wall, everywhere on what I tell myself.
07:56
Then I go to the gym.
07:57
I do my routine, I do my workout in the morning, weights.
08:00
Right after that, one of the things that I've been doing recently that I love, let me tell
08:03
you, this is a very fascinating thing, if you have the luxury of doing this.
08:07
I'm 6'5", 240, so my back and my knees feel it a lot, especially when I was in the Army,
08:12
we used to ruck march, with 50 pound backpacks.
08:15
It's what we used to do, right?
08:20
So, cryotherapy, is something I've started doing recently.
08:27
You literally stand there, with no shirt on, no clothes on, and you stand there, and this
08:32
thing starts and it goes all the way down to minus 240.
08:35
And the system I use -- there are many different ones, these machines run around $100,000 - it
08:40
goes to minus 240 for three minutes.
08:43
By the time you're done, what happens to the blood, the entire body, is flexible.
08:48
It feels like a million bucks, and your body gets shocked, is what it does.
08:53
Now I do this at 6:00 in the morning, so it works very, very effectively.
08:58
If you can do that at your gym, it's great.
09:00
Even if you do it once a week, I highly recommend it for you to try cryotherapy.
09:03
A good breakfast, you have to have a good breakfast, because that's your gas tank.
09:08
So remember, if you go and do 10 miles, 20 miles, 200 miles in your car, you need to
09:14
go to a gas station.
09:15
Breakfast meals are your gas stations.
09:18
You need to go fill up the tank.
09:19
Then I do my thinking.
09:21
These are the times that I do my thinking, I do my strategy sessions.
09:24
I do my ideation.
09:25
I think about what I'm working on, my next project, what needs help, what needs to be
09:30
improved.
09:31
Who do I need to call, what is my conversation going to sound like, what am I going to do
09:35
with this, what am I going to do with that, so it's thinking.
09:37
A lot of thinking and strategy.
09:39
And praying, definitely praying and meditating, catching up on news.
09:45
If my kids wake up early, they'll typically wake up at 6:45ish.
09:49
I'm typically gone by then, but I play with them when I get home.
09:54
And so that's typical with what my days look like in the morning.
09:56
Now one thing I'm going to tell you to give you some feedback on -- this is Monday - Saturday
10:01
of what my schedule looks like.
10:03
Sundays, playday.
10:05
Family day, fun day.
10:07
You know, there is nothing on Sunday going on, but me doing whatever I can to have fun
10:14
with my kids.
10:15
I look forward to Sundays because we have a great time together.
10:18
We play together, we enjoy each other's company.
10:21
My wife and I have a great time together.
10:23
We either swim in the pool or go and do all these other things that we do on a Sunday.
10:27
There's no set thing on what to do on Sunday.
10:29
Sunday is refueling, re-energizing, re-firing yourself up.
10:34
Then at night, there is a lot of preparation for the week, typically a couple of hours
10:39
of preparation for the week.
10:40
And then we start the day back up again the next day.
10:43
I typically will do a Facebook Mentions on Sunday night at 10:00, 9:00 recently to do
10:48
some Q&A, with other entrepreneurs from all around the world, and that's what my week
10:52
looks like.
10:53
Every week, there's one thing I want to tell you guys.
10:56
If you can't do it every week, I do recommend it every other week -- especially if your
11:00
body is in action, get a massage every other week, minimum.
11:06
Even if it's $60, a dollar a minute, I highly recommend it.
11:09
Get a massage, every other week, minimum.
11:14
This body that you have, you and I live in it, right?
11:16
We live in this body.
11:17
Let me explain.
11:19
We are not the body.
11:21
We are the spirit.
11:22
We're the mind, right?
11:24
We live in this body.
11:26
We need to take care of this body, and then it gives us a lot of miles.
11:30
It's like a car.
11:31
You buy a car, you know, you drive in the car, but you're not the car.
11:35
I don't know if I'm making any sense.
11:38
You're in the car, you're driving the car, but you're not the car.
11:41
The driver dictates how long that car can last.
11:46
You, the body is the car, but your mind, the heart, we, the spirit, are the driver.
11:53
The way you take care of this, this is going to last a long time.
11:55
Now obviously, we cannot unfortunately do anything at this point with some of the health
12:00
things that happen, cancer and all these other things that you don't have control of.
12:03
But you can definitely control energy, weight, being able to last, being able to do whatever
12:10
you can for your body to have more endurance, more stamina.
12:12
All of that is within your control.
12:15
And the better you get at doing that, the longer you can compete.
12:18
You know, Warren Buffett is at 70 billion and one of the things he believes in is buy
12:23
and hold -- and one of the things about success is for you to be able to buy and hold on to
12:29
your energy.
12:31
The longer your energy lasts, the longer your competitors are not going to last, because
12:37
your competitors are going to get tired.
12:39
They're eventually going to make so much money that their stomach is going to get big, they're
12:42
going to have the nice cars, nice house, everything, and then they're done.
12:46
They're done.
12:47
But you, if you truly want to play at the highest level and you want to go five, 10,
12:50
15, 20, 30, 40 year play - this is not a three-year, I'm going to be a millionaire and everyone's
12:54
going to say you're a rockstar.
12:55
That is boring.
12:56
If that's your play and if you think that's going to feel like a million bucks, it's not.
13:01
The play is constantly creating.
13:03
The play is constantly having the energy to come up with new ideas, engaging, sitting
13:07
in boardrooms knowing you've got the fire, you're in charge, you're doing all the right
13:11
things -- not all the right decisions all the time, but you're making the right decisions
13:15
51% of the time, and your other guys, your competitors, are getting tired.
13:19
And they're thinking about it.
13:21
And they eventually will say phrases like this -- and this is when you win -- when they
13:27
start saying, "Life is not all about success and money."Ah!
13:31
That's an alibi.
13:32
They've given up.
13:34
You win.
13:35
Of course life is not all about money.
13:37
If you're saying life is all about money, it's not.
13:40
But life is -- you've got 80 years.
13:44
What you do with this 80 years 80-100 years, whatever your timeline's going to be, that's
13:48
the impact you're going to make with the next generation.
13:50
I don't think we're here just for ourselves.
13:51
See, it's people that say, "Life isn't all about money" -- yeah.
13:54
You think life is only about you.
13:56
I don't think life is all about myself.
13:57
I think life is all about what I do for the next generation.
14:01
My example, my value, what I do with my kids, how I raise my boys, how I raise my daughter,
14:06
the way I treat my wife, my family, that dictates the exact play everyone's going to watch for
14:11
the next one.
14:12
That's what this means.
14:13
So, we need to know that our capacity, the purpose you have, the impact you can make
14:18
in the world is massive, but you need a lot of energy to do that.
14:22
So going back to the morning ritual, you can do research, there's plenty of research you
14:26
can do on different people and what they do.
14:28
But one of the most common things everyone has, is movement of the body, to create a
14:35
lot of energy, proper food, proper nutrition to be able to last a long time, more than
14:39
their competitors, just like in sports, just like in basketball, just like in boxing - what
14:44
do they say?
14:45
Let's see if you can last 12 rounds.
14:48
Let's see how they'll play in the fourth quarter.
14:50
Let's see how they're going to do in the third period when their legs are gone in hockey.
14:54
Let's see how they're going to do in stoppage time in soccer, when they're so tired, everyone's
14:59
tired.
15:01
Ronaldo recently won the championship -- it's in the stoppage time, and one of his teammates
15:05
scored a goal, he's hurt, that's the moment you win in business.
15:09
The moment you win in the business is when everybody's gone, when everyone's tired, and
15:12
you're still at the office, coming up with ideas, everybody's disappeared, you're left.
15:17
You're the last one standing.
15:19
And that's what it's going to take, and you better have lots of energy and stamina and
15:24
endurance, to be able to compete in this world, in the world of capitalism.
15:29
The world of capitalism favors those people that have high energy, high intensity, and
15:32
are willing to sustain that energy for long periods of time.
15:36
And you can do that, because there's a formula for it.
15:38
With that being said, Paul, throw me my favorite pillow.
15:42
Hey, 100,000 subs by August 31st.
15:45

[Good catch, Paul.
16:30
He played football before.
16:31
I'm not going to tell you about the league, but he did play football before.
16:35
And he's done many, many great things for himself in the world of football.]
16:39
So, if you've got questions, comment on the bottom.
16:41

17:00
Thanks so much everybody, take care, bye bye.
