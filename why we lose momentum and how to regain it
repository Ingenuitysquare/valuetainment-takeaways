Business, family, kids different reponsibles
* we notice that some parts of our life we are not doing well

Why someone would lose momentum about their business?
Momentum in business, money, what is the simplest way?

* everything in life requires attention...
Pay attention to yourself health, business, people you are sorrounded with give them the proper attention
with the intention to understant how to keep the focus.

* life is about giving attention to things that matter... learn where and how to keep giving attention to those things 

What is intentional attention?
Imagine the case when you plan with whome, where and what you are going to talk about and give importance to...
Talking to someone specifically about that can lead to intentional attention.

In another example imagine being in the gym taking care of your body but at the same time paying attention to giving-getting feedback for your business colleagues. 

# The number one reason why so many lose momentum

-because of start stop
initially you may get excited starting and making 3-5-10 grant/months ...then ...back down to 11-7-3-1 / month...

why did they stop (stomach full, got at the level you wanted...?)
what causes that... are you clear who do you want to be in life, who?
Have you asked yourself what kind of life do I want to live?
what do you want to have materialistic posessions i.e just a house, money, accolades or legacy?
Imagine what are people going to say when you die, friends, people who knew you... if anything?
...and then they're forgotten. Am I aware why it happens...?

# seconnd things is a question...

Have you asked yourself who do you want to be?

Do you know what is your anticipated "runnway"
* To achieve the life you want to live requires building momentum keeping and being aware of its dynamics..

Who do you want to be in life?
