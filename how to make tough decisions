# How to make tough decisions

1. Game Theory
Think of the movied a beautiful mind inspired by John Nash the mathematician... Game theory is a theory with the theory 
that the odds of your decision would favor you

Imagine this scenario

John | Boby

[John-Boby][no-snitch][snitch]
[no-snitch][2/2][10/0]
[snitch][0/10][5/5]

What would you do about it?
-are you geniuine friends?
-part of family?
-are you okay to take the consequences?

If you do not snitch you get the decision for 2 or 10
In life every decision you will have to the decision if you take decision what consequences you expect?

2. Worst case scenario
Calculate the risks by taking the worst case scenario. 
If I decide to join the army, create a family, create a business... 
Think and prepare mentally the worst case scenario.
...If the answer is "Yes" after you ask yourself clearly what could be the worse thing that could happen and you get mentally prepared then, go for that decision.

3. The decisions must match your values and principles
If an opportunity is attractive and do not match your values and principles do not think twice, move on.

4. Go get great counsel
Meet every quarter and make tough decisions with people that are as neutral about your current case/scenario

Being absolutely reasonable without adding emotions about it. You should get another angle / perspective of thinking you did not think before.

5. What is your alternative?
You are close to getting the decision... though not ready to execute? while at this point is best to check your alternatives.
Sit down with the decision and evaluate your alternatives

6. Decision fatigue
Car salesmens probably know best that the longer they keep the customer the better the likelyhood of the customers to finish/decide what to buy... since they just want to get it done.

This goes to tell us that:
-Never make a massive decision when you are fatigue. Find the right prime time for you have the quality thoughts for decisions/
if not simply ask for another time to make that decision, do not be shy saying: "Sorry guys I need some time to think about this decision, I cannot make it right now."

7. Stick with your decision
Once you make the decision do not go back to review it... which leads to a downloads emotional cycle. 
...Imagine the consequences when you might hire way to fast but fire way too slow... it could be better to hire slow and fire fast.

Buying, investing, selling, starting/stopping relationships... etc which ever decision was done by you do not re-visit it. Move on and learn how to better make tough decisions )
