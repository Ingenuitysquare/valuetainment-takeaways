# Strategic thinkers

short tem - mid - long term
which one do you belong to? in which category do I fall into ? I am good at stregising 
in all three categories? what does it take to be a quality thinker and stragise for all three of those categories?

-Short term thinkers problem solvers (second to hour)
-Mid term thinkers (day to day)
-Long term thinkers (month, quarter, year/annual)

short term thinker second to second / moment to moment decision taken about a certain issue
mid term thinker able to strategise for a day to day case within 24 hours you get the decision/results
long term thinker thinks about the plans for month to month, quarter to quarter, year to year strategist

One could think of different analogies from the real world i.e. what it takes to stragies in the military, firefighting, military etc.
